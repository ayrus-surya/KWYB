# KWYB
Know Where You Book
KWYB will be our website to enable PES students/faculties to book rooms, seminar halls, 
auditorium etc for their events or for any purpose. 
This website will help streamline allotment of various events for various activities 
without much hassle about the final venue. 
The website will have many other features but booking of venues will be the primary functionality. 
Not just venues, we will extend support for booking of lecturers for extra lectures. 
We will also be maintaining a gallery displaying the images of the venues and give description of 
the facilities available at that particular venue. 
We will be maintaining a PES news feed as well. 
Many other functionalities will also be added.
